      &nbsp; <span class="subhead">Spring 2016, David Matuszek</span> </header>
    <h1>Purposes of this assignment</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>To give you some experience with dictionaries and sets</li>
      <li>To give you more practice with writing tests</li>
      <li>To get you started thinking about how to solve problems with programs</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>General idea of the assignment</h1>
    <p>Suppose there are a number of "cities," as in Figure 1 below. The
      distance between any two cities is the standard Euclidean distance, that
      is, √((x<sub>1</sub>-x<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>+(y<sub>1</sub>-y<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>).
      A traveling salesman wishes to visit every city exactly once, then return
      to his starting point. (It doesn't matter what city is the starting
      point.) Such a path is called a <span class="definiendum">circuit</span>,
      as in Figure 2. However, the salesman also wishes to minimize the total
      distance that must be traveled.</p>

    </table>
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Solutions from the web</h2>
    <p>This is a classic computer science problem, known as the T<strong>raveling
        Salesman problem.</strong> You can find algorithms for finding
      reasonably good solutions on the web, and you are welcome to look at those
      algorithms. However, I want you use a <span class="definiendum">hill
        climbing</span> approach, where you start with "any" solution, and try
      to progressively improve it until you can't improve it any more.</p>
    <p>This should require <em>you</em> to think about how to solve the
      problem, rather than just copying some algorithm you may or may not
      understand. Your final solution is unlikely to be the optimal (best
      possible) solution, but that's okay, so long as it isn't obviously
      terrible. </p>
    <h1>Specific requirements</h1>
    <h2>Data representation</h2>
    <p>I am providing a file, <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/cit590-2016/Assignments/city-data.txt">city-data.txt</a>,
      containing the latitudes and longitudes of the 50 state capitals of the
      U.S. Each line contains the name of the state, the name of the city, the
      latitude, and the longitude. These four items are separated by <strong>tabs</strong>.
      Read this file in as a list of 4-tuples.</p>
    <p>The list of 4-tuples will be referred to as a "road map." It represents
      the path the salesman follows, starting with the first city in the list
      and ending back at the first city in the list.</p>
    <p>While I will require these particular data representations as function
      parameters and function results, this does not imply that you have to work
      with these representations as you solve the problems. Python makes it easy
      to convert from one kind of sequence to another.</p>
    <h2>Required functions (file <code>cities.py</code>)</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>def read_cities(<em>file_name</em>)</code></dt>
      <dd>Read in the cities from the given <code><em>file_name</em></code>,
        and return them as a list of four-tuples: <code>[(<em>state</em>, <em>city</em>,
          <em>latitude</em>, <em>longitude</em>), ...] </code>Use this as your
        initial <code><em>road_map</em></code>, that is, the cycle Alabama →
        Alaska → Arizona → ... → Wyoming → Alabama.</dd>
      <dt><code>def print_cities(</code><code><code><em>road_map</em></code>)</code></dt>
      <dd>Prints a list of cities, along with their locations. Print only one or
        two digits after the decimal point.</dd>
      <dt><code>def compute_total_distance(<em>road_ma<span style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">p</span></em><em></em>)</code></dt>
      <dd>Returns, as a floating point number, the sum of the distances of all
        the connections in the <em><code>road_map</code></em><code><em></em></code>.
        Remember that it's a cycle, so that (for example) in the initial
        road_map, Wyoming connects to Alabama..</dd>
      <dt><code>def swap_adjacent_cities(<em>road_map</em>, <em>index</em>)</code></dt>
      <dd>Take the city at location <code><em>index </em></code>in the <code><em>road_map</em></code>,
        and the city at location <code><em>index</em>+1</code> (or at 0, if <code><em>index</em></code>
        refers to the last element in the list), swap their positions in the <code><em>road_map</em></code>,
        compute the new total distance, and return the tuple<code> (<em>new_road_map</em>,
          <em>new_total_distance</em>)</code>.</dd>
      <dt><code>def swap_cities(<em>road_map</em>, <em>index1, index2</em>)</code></dt>
      <dd>Take the city at location <code><em>index </em></code>in the <code><em>road_map</em></code>,
        and the city at location <code><em>index2</em></code>, swap their
        positions in the <code><em>road_map</em></code>, compute the new total
        distance, and return the tuple<code> (<em>new_road_map</em>, <em>new_total_distance</em>)</code>.
        Allow the possibility that <code><em>index1</em>=<em>index2</em></code>,
        and handle this case correctly.</dd>
      <dt><code>def find_best_cycle(<em>road_map</em>)</code></dt>
      <dd>Using a combination of <code>swap_cities </code>and <code>swap_adjacent_cities</code>,
        try 10000 swaps, and each time keep the best cycle found so far. After
        10000 swaps, return the best cycle found so far.</dd>
      <dt><code>def print_map(<em>road_map</em>)</code></dt>
      <dd>Prints, in an easily understandable format, the cities and their
        connections, along with the cost for each connection and the total cost.</dd>
      <dt><code>def main()</code></dt>
      <dd>Reads in and prints out the city data, then creates the "best" cycle
        and prints it out.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>Required tests (file <code>cities_test.py</code>)</h2>
    <p>Programs should be tested as thoroughly as possible. Functions that do
      input or output are difficult to test. Therefore, functions that do input
      or output should do as little computation as possible, and functions that
      do computation should do no input or output.</p>
    <p>In this assignment <code>main</code>,<code> print_cities</code>, and<code>
        print_map</code> result in input or output, so do not write unit tests
      for these. Unit test all the other functions, as well as any additional
      computational functions you might write.</p>
    <p><strong>TDD</strong>, <strong>Test Driven Design</strong>, <em>really
        is</em> a good idea. Here is the general approach:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Write a stub for each function. (A <span class="definiendum">stub</span>
        is a function that does nothing or, if it must return a value, returns a
        value that is unlikely to be correct.)</li>
      <li>Pick a function--if possible, one that does not depend on any other
        functions you haven't yet written--and write a test for it. Run the test
        and make sure it fails.</li>
      <li>Improve the function just enough to make it pass the test.</li>
      <li>If the function needs to do more, then expand the test (or add another
        test) to test the new functionality. Run the test and make sure it
        fails. Then return to step 3. Repeat as many times as necessary until
        the function is complete.</li>
      <li>If any functions remain to be written, return to step 2.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Programming hints</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>You don't need any global variables.</li>
      <li>Import <code>random</code> at the top of your program; then <code>number&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000&nbsp;*&nbsp;random.random()</code>
        will give you a floating-point number in the range <code>0.0&nbsp;&lt;=&nbsp;number&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1000.0</code>.</li>
      <li>If you want to treat a list <code>lst</code> as circular (the first
        item follows the last item), the item after <code>lst[i] </code>is<code><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: serif;">
            </span></span></code>not just<code> <nobr>lst(i + 1)</nobr></code>,
        but is <code><nobr>lst[(i + 1) % len(lst)]</nobr> </code>.</li>
      <li>If you haven't yet read my <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/cit590-2016/Pages/unit_testing_in_python.html">Unit
          Testing writeup</a> (linked to from the course home page), now would
        be a good time to do so. </li>
      <li>Don't use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29#Unnamed_numerical_constants">magic
          numbers</a>! For example, there happen to be 50 cities in the data set
        you are given, but don't use <code>50</code> in your code;&nbsp; can
        use something like <code>len(<em>city_list</em>)</code> instead.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Grading</h1>
    <p>The assignment will be graded on the basis of 100 points total.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Correctness.</strong> We will have <em>our own unit tests,</em>
        which your functions must pass. This means that (1) the above functions
        must take parameters and produce results <em>exactly</em> as specified,
        or our test will fail and cost you points, and (2) your own unit tests
        should be good enough to catch any errors before we do.</li>
      <li><strong>Style. </strong>Use proper indentation (4 spaces) and proper
        spacing. Use good, self-explanatory variable and function names. Don't
        repeat code if you can put it in a function and just call the function.
        Don't use "magic numbers" (unexplained constants in your code); give
        them names. Try to avoid redundancy (such as the beginner's <code>if&nbsp;better&nbsp;==&nbsp;True</code>).
        </li>
